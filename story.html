<h1>CHEESE PRODUCTION  &amp; ITS EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>America loves cheese. In fact, in 2009, McDonald’s bought <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2011/4/29/6683657/burgers-by-the-numbers-mcdonalds">213 million pounds</a> of it. There’s national holidays dedicated to cheese (national grilled cheese day was on April 17th, but there’s still time to prep for national cheese lover’s day, on Jan. 20). There’s <a href="http://grilledcheesesocial.com/">blogs</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Insidercheese/">social media pages</a> and trends even dedicated to our favorite milk byproduct. On Instagram alone, there are more than 5,600 photos hashtagged with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cheesepull/?hl=en">“#cheesepull.”</a></p>

<p>One thing is certain– we make a lot of cheese. In 2015, the U.S. produced <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_Subject/result.php?B4495177-A04A-3C0D-8910-3DBB28D8D054&sector=ANIMALS%20%26%20PRODUCTS&group=DAIRY&comm=CHEESE">22,802,766,000 pounds.</a> And we tend eat a lot of it too: The average American eats <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/12/31/144478009/the-average-american-ate-literally-a-ton-this-year">630 pounds</a> of dairy products a year, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-has-massive-cheese-surplus-180958985/">34.1 pounds</a> of cheese specifically. But with 321 million people in the U.S., that means only about half of all cheese produced in 2015 was consumed that year. While wasting cheese may not seem like a big deal, cheese production is pretty resource intensive. Taking care of animals, processing the milk and transportation of the finished product are just parts of the process. And as it turns out, cheese production is a contributor to climate change, or, at least the acceleration of it. </p>

<p>However, to understand why cheese making is taking a toll on the environment, we need to understand how it’s produced. The <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/284762DF-AAE3-33E5-8FF9-65F61D89AC7A">United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service</a> keeps detailed datasets on tons of subjects– including agriculture. According to Donnie Fike, a <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Contact_Us/Ask_a_Specialist/index.php">dairy products statistician</a> in the livestock branch at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, the USDA uses monthly electronic forms and mail outs to collect the data for their reports. There are 1,272 dairies in the U.S., and they hear from all of them.</p>

<p>“It’s a monthly survey that dairy processing plants complete,” Fike said. “We get it a couple different ways– we have electronic data reporting, which is actually a website where the plant manager or bookkeeper can log in and actually put their information in. Or there are some that we actually mail out and people complete it and mail it back.”
</p>

<p>However, some of the smaller dairies are a bit late with their reporting. According to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/DairProdSu/DairProdSu-04-27-2017.pdf">Dairy Products 2016 Summary</a>, only some of the smaller dairy production facilities are contacted monthly. The others send their reports after the close of the year. However, these facilities do not make up a large part of the production totals anyway. </p>

<p>Cheese production all starts with milk. According to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1103">USDA</a>, in Feb. 2017, the U.S. produced 15.7 billion pounds of milk.</p>


<div id="container">
</div>

<p>As previously stated, in 2011, the U.S. produces upwards of 22 billion pounds of cheese per year and only consumed around half of it. However, the U.S. alone is sitting on a <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/dnac3.pdf">stockpile</a> of around 1.191 billion pounds of American cheese. Due to this excess amount of cheese, the USDA announced that it would buy $20 million dollars’ worth of cheese and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/26/491362623/americas-real-mountain-of-cheese-is-on-our-plates">donate it to local food banks</a>. In their April 24 to April 28, 2017 report the United States Department of Agriculture’s <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dywweeklyreport.pdf">Dairy Market News</a> the report states that milk is in good supply, and is increasing, which means cheese production will continue to rise as well. However, the underlying question remains– what the heck is the U.S. doing with all that leftover cheese?!</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Dairy Export Council, from 2015 to 2016 <a href="http://www.usdec.org/research-and-data/market-information">U.S. exports of cheese</a> rose 8 percent, but exports have been rising since around Dec. 2010.</p>

<div id="containerthree"></div>

<p>And the demand for more new and exotic cheese just keeps growing. In 2012, upwards of 11 million pounds of cheddar cheese, alone was sold in the U.S. The weight of that amount of cheese itself is about equivalent to the weight of 1,128 <a href="http://www.scapt.org/files/download/school%20bus%20types.pdf">conventional school buses</a> (without the kids…) According to the USDA’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/forum/2016_speeches/Agricultural_Outlook_Forum_2016_Dairy_Final.pdf">Dairy Outlook</a> U.S. imports of cheese were 23 percent higher in 2015 than in 2014.</p>

<p>Dairy has even made it into the White House. During President Donald Trump’s recent trip to Wisconsin, he promised to find a solution to a trade dispute that has been imposed by Canada. The <a href="https://apnews.com/5e8316c933774060ab3b4ac73badee58">Associated Press</a> reported that Canada decided to lower the price of their dairy products, which competes with American-made dairy products. This affects 70 dairy producers in Wisconsin and New York, which makes up around six percent of the total dairy producers in the U.S.</p>

<p>Political nonsense aside, all this cheese making is starting to be of concern when it comes to the environment. Cheese production generates the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/">third highest</a> amount of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. All the extra heat in our atmosphere causes the polar ice caps to melt, which leads to sea level rise. These harmful gases– carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases are all byproducts of human activities like fossil fuel consumption, industrial processes, livestock management, and more. These activities are speeding up the emissions of greenhouse gases and are causing the planet harm.</p>

<p>Two of the more harmful gases are carbon dioxide and methane. According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/2017_complete_report.pdf">Environmental Protection Agency’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</a> from 1990 to 2015, within our current agricultural practices carbon dioxide is mostly emitted by human activities like operating machinery. Some of the machinery requires fossil fuels, which is the highest emitter of carbon dioxide to date. One way to combat greenhouse gas emissions from dairy factories would be to rely more on renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.</p>

<p>The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks report says that, enteric fermentation is the largest producer of methane in the United States. According to a paper from <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/others/TakApr08.html">Iowa State University</a>, methane emissions from the agricultural sector mainly come from enteric fermentation, which is part of the natural digestive process in animals. When the feed ferments during the digestive process, it produces methane as a byproduct. The methane is usually emitted through the animals’ exhaling and belching. Because of cattle’s unique digestive system (<a href="http://aitc.ca/bc/uploads/ruminants.pdf">they have four stomachs</a>) they are the highest emitter of methane. Dairy cows alone, emit 25 percent of the total enteric fermentation methane emissions. According to information from the Greenhous Gas Emissions and Sinks report dairy cattle’s methane emissions have been on the rise since 1990.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_Subject/index.php?sector=ANIMALS%20&%20PRODUCTS">United States Department of Agriculture (UDSA)</a>, in Feb. 2017 there were 8.69 million dairy cows in the 23-major dairy producing states.</p>

<p>But methane emissions don’t only come from bodily functions. Another example of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/2017_complete_report.pdf">methane emissions</a> could also be seen in activities like manure management, which have risen by 64.2 percent since 1990. One way the agricultural industry could remedy this problem would be to purchase higher quality feed so it is easier for the animals to digest. With better feed, the methane emissions from the dairy industry may decrease over time.</p>

<p>However, some dairies are working on decreasing their methane emissions from waste management. Joseph Gallo Farms houses around 16,000 cattle across five dairy facilities in Merced County, Calif. and processes around 900,000 pounds of milk per day. According to their <a href="https://building-microgrid.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/dercam_casestudy_josephgallofarms_v1_2%5B1%5D.pdf">project profile</a> each of those cows produces around 120 pounds of liquid and solid waste a day. By installing an anaerobic digester, which generates electricity and produces biogas from the manure, Gallo farms has managed to reduce its methane emissions and generates <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Gigawatt_hours_(GWh)">5.6 Gigawatt hours</a> of electricity onsite every year.<p>

<p>However, the U.S. isn’t the only one producing excess methane and carbon dioxide with wasted cheese. The upkeep of the livestock, the processing of the milk and the transportation of the final product are all large greenhouse gas emitters globally, according to The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Animal Production and Health Division.  A report titled, <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/k7930e/k7930e00.pdf">Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the Dairy Sector</a> report estimated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy production. The goal of this report is to provide estimates of greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy production, including the emissions from dairy processing, transportation of products, production of packaging and the life cycle of the dairy cattle themselves.</p>

<p>In their report, the FAO split the production cycle into two sub-systems– “cradle to farm-gate,” which includes the livestock production up to the point where the animals leave the farm. The second sub-system is “farm-gate to retail,” which covers transportation to dairy plants, processing, production of packaging and transportation to the retailer. Cheese production falls mainly into the post-farm gate category.
The report found that in 2007, the amount of milk produced globally was around 553 tons. The emissions from the dairy herd totaled at an estimated 1,969 million tons of CO2, with 1,328 million tons of that attributed to milk production alone. This means that milk production contributed around 2.7 percent to the total anthropogenic emissions in 2007.</p>

<p>While the U.S. is still responsible, it was found that the less developed countries around the world tended to have higher greenhouse gas emissions throughout their LCAs. In North America, 78 to 83 percent of the emissions from the total gases emitted during dairy production are generated on the dairy farms. However, America still processes more milk than developing countries, so we should keep that in mind as well.
When it comes to cheese making, greenhouse gas emissions depend on quite a few factors– the distance between the production site and dairy plant, type of processing, type of packaging, distance of transport, and more.</p>

<p>As we’ve all heard thousands of times, “nothing is perfect” which also applies to the dairy sector. The FAO’s report suggests that to lower the emissions during the post farm-gate activities, the agricultural sector could help the environment by choosing renewable energy sources and more eco-friendly packaging.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/reducing-your-footprint/">Environmental Working Group</a>, if a single four-person family skips meat and cheese for a single day a week, it is equivalent to taking one car off the road for five weeks. Additionally, they found that if everyone in the U.S. skipped meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be almost equivalent to taking 7.6 million cars off the road. Moral of the story is, if you skip cheese for one day a week, you could have a significant impact on the environment.</p>

<p>While cheese is delicious, it may be worth it to take a little break. Sorry cheese, it’s not you, it’s just all of your negative effects on the environment. Too attached to dairy to take a breather? That’s okay too. Less dense cheeses, like cottage cheese, tend to result in less greenhouse gas emissions as they take less milk to produce. So, next time you take a slice off the old block just appreciate what went into it– and maybe skip cheese the next day.</p>
