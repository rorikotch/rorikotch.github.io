<h1>CHEESE PRODUCTION  &amp; ITS EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>America loves cheese. In fact, in 2009, McDonald’s bought <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2011/4/29/6683657/burgers-by-the-numbers-mcdonalds">213 million pounds</a> of it. There’s national holidays dedicated to cheese (national grilled cheese day was on April 17th, but there’s still time to prep for national cheese lover’s day, on Jan. 20). There’s <a href="http://grilledcheesesocial.com/">blogs</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Insidercheese/">social media pages</a> and trends even dedicated to our favorite milk byproduct. On Instagram alone, there are more than 5,600 photos hashtagged with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cheesepull/?hl=en">“#cheesepull.”</a></p>

<p>One thing is certain– we make a lot of cheese. In 2015, the U.S. produced <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_Subject/result.php?B4495177-A04A-3C0D-8910-3DBB28D8D054&sector=ANIMALS%20%26%20PRODUCTS&group=DAIRY&comm=CHEESE">22,802,766,000 pounds.</a> And we tend eat a lot of it too: The average American eats <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/12/31/144478009/the-average-american-ate-literally-a-ton-this-year">630 pounds</a> of dairy products a year, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-has-massive-cheese-surplus-180958985/">34.1 pounds</a> of cheese specifically. But with 321 million people in the U.S., that means only about half of all cheese produced in 2015 was consumed that year. While wasting cheese may not seem like a big deal, cheese production is pretty resource intensive. Taking care of animals, processing the milk and transportation of the finished product are just parts of the process. And as it turns out, cheese production is a contributor to climate change, or, at least the acceleration of it. </p>

<p>However, to understand why cheese making is taking a toll on the environment, we need to understand how it’s produced. The <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/284762DF-AAE3-33E5-8FF9-65F61D89AC7A">United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service</a> keeps detailed datasets on tons of subjects– including agriculture. According to Donnie Fike, a <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Contact_Us/Ask_a_Specialist/index.php">dairy products statistician</a> in the livestock branch at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, the USDA uses monthly electronic forms and mail outs to collect the data for their reports. There are 1,272 dairies in the U.S., and they hear from all of them.</p>

<p>“It’s a monthly survey that dairy processing plants complete,” Fike said. “We get it a couple different ways– we have electronic data reporting, which is actually a website where the plant manager or bookkeeper can log in and actually put their information in. Or there are some that we actually mail out and people complete it and mail it back.”
</p>

<p>However, some of the smaller dairies are a bit late with their reporting. According to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/usda/current/DairProdSu/DairProdSu-04-27-2017.pdf">Dairy Products 2016 Summary</a>, only some of the smaller dairy production facilities are contacted monthly. The others send their reports after the close of the year. However, these facilities do not make up a large part of the production totals anyway. </p>

<p>Cheese production all starts with milk. According to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1103">USDA</a>, in Feb. 2017, the U.S. produced 15.7 billion pounds of milk.</p>


<div id="container">
</div>

<p>As previously stated, in 2011, the U.S. produces upwards of 22 billion pounds of cheese per year and only consumed around half of it. However, the U.S. alone is sitting on a <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/dnac3.pdf">stockpile</a> of around 1.191 billion pounds of American cheese. Due to this excess amount of cheese, the USDA announced that it would buy $20 million dollars’ worth of cheese and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/26/491362623/americas-real-mountain-of-cheese-is-on-our-plates">donate it to local food banks</a>. In their April 24 to April 28, 2017 report the United States Department of Agriculture’s <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dywweeklyreport.pdf">Dairy Market News</a> the report states that milk is in good supply, and is increasing, which means cheese production will continue to rise as well. However, the underlying question remains– what the heck is the U.S. doing with all that leftover cheese?!</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Dairy Export Council, from 2015 to 2016 <a href="http://www.usdec.org/research-and-data/market-information">U.S. exports of cheese</a> rose 8 percent, but exports have been rising since around Dec. 2010.</p>

<div id="containerthree"></div>

<p>And the demand for more new and exotic cheese just keeps growing. In 2012, upwards of 11 million pounds of cheddar cheese, alone was sold in the U.S. The weight of that amount of cheese itself is about equivalent to the weight of 1,128 <a href="http://www.scapt.org/files/download/school%20bus%20types.pdf">conventional school buses</a> (without the kids…) According to the USDA’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/forum/2016_speeches/Agricultural_Outlook_Forum_2016_Dairy_Final.pdf">Dairy Outlook</a> U.S. imports of cheese were 23 percent higher in 2015 than in 2014.</p>

<p>Dairy has even made it into the White House. During President Donald Trump’s recent trip to Wisconsin, he promised to find a solution to a trade dispute that has been imposed by Canada. The <a href="https://apnews.com/5e8316c933774060ab3b4ac73badee58">Associated Press</a> reported that Canada decided to lower the price of their dairy products, which competes with American-made dairy products. This affects 70 dairy producers in Wisconsin and New York, which makes up around six percent of the total dairy producers in the U.S.</p>

<p>Political nonsense aside, all this cheese making is starting to be of concern when it comes to the environment. Cheese production generates the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/">third highest</a> amount of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. All the extra heat in our atmosphere causes the polar ice caps to melt, which leads to sea level rise. These harmful gases– carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases are all byproducts of human activities like fossil fuel consumption, industrial processes, livestock management, and more. These activities are speeding up the emissions of greenhouse gases and are causing the planet harm.</p>

<p>Two of the more harmful gases are carbon dioxide and methane. According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/2017_complete_report.pdf">Environmental Protection Agency’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks</a> from 1990 to 2015, within our current agricultural practices carbon dioxide is mostly emitted by human activities like operating machinery. Some of the machinery requires fossil fuels, which is the highest emitter of carbon dioxide to date. One way to combat greenhouse gas emissions from dairy factories would be to rely more on renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.</p>

<p>The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks report says that, enteric fermentation is the largest producer of methane in the United States. According to a paper from <a href="https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/others/TakApr08.html">Iowa State University</a>, methane emissions from the agricultural sector mainly come from enteric fermentation, which is part of the natural digestive process in animals. When the feed ferments during the digestive process, it produces methane as a byproduct. The methane is usually emitted through the animals’ exhaling and belching. Because of cattle’s unique digestive system (<a href="http://aitc.ca/bc/uploads/ruminants.pdf">they have four stomachs</a>) they are the highest emitter of methane. Dairy cows alone, emit 25 percent of the total enteric fermentation methane emissions. According to information from the Greenhous Gas Emissions and Sinks report dairy cattle’s methane emissions have been on the rise since 1990.</p>

<p>While the U.S. is a large exporter for cheese, the demand for imported cheese has increased drastically throughout the recent years. In 2012, 11,277,329 pounds of cheddar cheese, alone was sold in the U.S. This amount of cheese is about equivalent to 1,128 conventional school buses. According to the USDA’s Dairy Outlook from Feb. 26, 2016 the exports of cheese dropped by 14 percent from 2014 to 2015. However, the U.S. imports of cheese was 23 percent higher in 2015 as compared to 2014. </p>
