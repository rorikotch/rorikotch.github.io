<h1>CHEESE PRODUCTION  &amp; IT'S EFFECTS ON THE EVIRONMENT</h1>

<p>America loves cheese. In 2009, McDonald’s bought <a href="http://chicago.eater.com/2011/4/29/6683657/burgers-by-the-numbers-mcdonalds">213 million pounds</a> of cheese. There’s national holidays dedicated to cheese– national cheese lover’s day (Jan. 20, 2018), national grilled cheese day (April 12, 2017) and more. There’s blogs, social media pages and trends even dedicated to our favorite food. On Instagram, there are 5,223 photos filed under the hashtag “#cheesepull.”</p>

<p>In 2015 the U.S. produced 22,802,766,000 pounds of cheese.The average American eats 630 pounds of dairy products a year. According to the United States Census Bureau, there were around 320,917,656 U.S. citizens on July 4, 2015, which means, around 36,194,866 pounds of that cheese was consumed in 2015. The production of cheese requires care of the animals, processing, transportation and more, and these activities produce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.Cheese production all starts with milk. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in Feb. 2017, the U.S. produced 15.7 billion pounds of milk.</p>

<p>To process the cheese, the milk goes through a variety of stages, which all depend on which type of cheese is being made. Generally, first the milk is tested for quality. Then, the milk is pasteurized to get rid of unsafe bacteria. After that, coagulants are added to the milk, which curdles the milk into a thick mass. The curdles are then cut and separated from the liquid, or whey. Larger curds in the curd yield softer cheeses like ricotta, and smaller cuts yield harder cheeses like parmesan. Once the curd is cut it is heated to yield the desired firmness for the specific type of cheese being made. After the curds are fully formed, they are pressed, which completes the curd making process. The curd is pressed at various weights and times, depending on which cheese is being produced. Finally, the cheese is sent to cure, which is where the magic happens– the curd becomes cheese. Depending on what type of cheese is being produced, the cheese is brought to different rooms with varying temperatures and humidity. Depending on the type of cheese being produced the following processes vary.</p>

<p>According to the United States Department of Agriculture (UDSA), in Feb. 2017 there were 8.69 million dairy cows in the 23-major dairy producing states.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Dairy Export Council, from 2015 to 2016 U.S. exports of cheese rose 8 percent. However, exports have been rising since around Dec. 2010.</p>
<p>The largest importers of U.S. cheese include Mexico, South East Asia, Pakistan, China and Peru, respectively. In 2016, the U.S. exported a total of 528,606 pounds of cheese just to these countries alone– and all of this transportation adds up. According to the U.S. Dairy Export Council’s Global Dairy Market Outlook, exportation of U.S. cheese has increased by eight percent from 2016.</p>

<p>While the U.S. is a large exporter for cheese, the demand for imported cheese has increased drastically throughout the recent years. In 2012, 11,277,329 pounds of cheddar cheese, alone was sold in the U.S. This amount of cheese is about equivalent to 1,128 conventional school buses. According to the USDA’s Dairy Outlook from Feb. 26, 2016 the exports of cheese dropped by 14 percent from 2014 to 2015. However, the U.S. imports of cheese was 23 percent higher in 2015 as compared to 2014. </p>
