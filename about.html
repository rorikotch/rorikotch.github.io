      <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hey! Nice to meet you, I'm Rori Kotch. I am a photographer, writer, graphic designer and an all-around computer geek. </p>
        <p>In my free time I like to cook new recipes, sail, paint and draw. Currently I'm a senior at the University of Miami studying journalism, studio art and architecture. You might be thinking, "how do all these go together?" They don't! Well, art and journalism do a little, I guess. </p>
        <p>At UM I serve as the Editor-in-Chief of Distraction Magazine, the magazine of the students of the University of Miami. This is my second year as editor and I love it. If you have a second, check out our <a href="http://www.distractionmagazine.com/">website!</a> </p> <!--The link here won't work!-->
        <p>This year I have also had the pleasure of interning at Gulfstream Media Group where I served as an editorial intern in the fall and social media intern in the spring. This summer I will take my talents up to New York City to serve as an intern at M.Shanken Communications, which includes Wine Spectator, Cigar Aficionado and Whiskey Advocate. I will be working in both the art department and with the social media team. In the fall I will be attending graduate school at the University of Miami in their Interactive Media Master's program.</p>

        <p>I am available for freelance editorial, design or photography.</p>
